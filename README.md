# Peptide-Analyzer
A GUI-based utility that provides visualization for the positional occurrence of amino acids in aligned peptide sequences.

## Overview

The program currently only provides visualization for the positional occurrence of amino acids as well as normalized positional occurence. In the future there will be additional functionality including clustering of peptide sequences to identify similar characteristics.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository into a directory.
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the 'Peptide-Analyzer-master' folder.
3. Type: 'python peptide-analysis.py'


This will bring up a GUI window where the input file can be chosen, as well as an output folder.

# TO-DO:
1. Identify methods by which 2D clustering can be applied to sequences
2. Implement a more thorough analysis of the aligned sequences, add support for '-' characters to account for gaps in the alignment.
